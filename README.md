# Technical Report: React Stationery App

## 1. Application Purpose

This application is a demonstration system for stationery management, focused on front-end best practices, usability, and modular architecture. It simulates an admin dashboard with authentication, user CRUD, document upload, contact form, product visualization, and sales dashboard.

## 2. Technologies Used

- **React** (with hooks and functional components)
- **Vite** (build and development environment)
- **Bootstrap 5** (styling and responsiveness)
- **Bootstrap Icons** (visual icons)
- **Chart.js** (pie charts)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**

## 3. Architecture and Organization

- **src/pages/**: Main pages (Users, Products, Documents, Contact, AboutUs, Login)
- **src/layout/**: Structural components (Header, Footer, Body)
- **src/components/**: Reusable components (e.g., PieChart)
- **src/features/**: (Reserved for future features)
- **src/shared/**: (Reserved for utilities and shared resources)
- **assets/**: Images and static resources

The app follows the separation of concerns pattern, making maintenance, testing, and scalability easier.

## 4. Patterns and Best Practices

- **Componentization**: Each feature is an isolated, reusable component.
- **Form validation**: All forms have validation and visual feedback.
- **Login persistence**: Uses localStorage to keep the user session.
- **Responsiveness**: Layout adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Clean Code**: Organized folders, clear names, commented code, and no duplication.
- **Hooks usage**: State and effects managed with useState/useEffect.

## 5. AI Improvement Possibilities

- **Support Chatbot**: Integrate a virtual assistant for user questions and support.
- **Smart Recommendations**: Suggest products based on user purchase profile.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Forecast sales and stock trends using machine learning models.
- **Document Recognition**: Automate reading and classification of uploaded documents.
- **Automatic Report Generation**: Use AI to create dynamic reports and business insights.

## 6. How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
	```sh
	npm install
	```
2. Run the app:
	```sh
	npm run dev
	```
3. Access at `http://localhost:5173` (or configured port)
